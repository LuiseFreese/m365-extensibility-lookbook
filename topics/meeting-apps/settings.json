          "Meetings are key to productivity in Teams. They enable collaboration, partnership, informed communication, and shared feedback in an inclusive and active forum. As a developer, you can create configurable tab, bot, and message extension applications to enhance and enrich a Teams meeting experience.",
          "Meeting users can access apps, via the tab gallery, to enable relevant scenarios such as pre-staging a Kanban board, launching an in-meeting actionable dialog, or creating a post-meeting poll. Your meeting app can deliver a user experience for each stage of the meeting lifecycle based upon attendee status."
